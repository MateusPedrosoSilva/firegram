## Firegram
Firegram is a photo gallery. Where the user can upload images. The application is in real time, it was built with ReactJS and Firebase.

## Motivation
The purpose of this repository is to review some `ReactJS` concepts and use `Firebase` as a backend for the application. And I used `Framer-motion` for the website's animations.
